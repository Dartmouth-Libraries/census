# Data & Democracy

Conversation Starters:

::: incremental
1.  What conditions does a society need for democracy to function effectively?
2.  How can we measure or quantify the presence of these conditions?

# Counting People

-   earliest forms of writing: count & record livestock & commodities

-   early governments: counting people for the purpose of taxation

    -   documentation allowed the accumulation of wealth (i.e. by state, royalty, religious institutions)

Giorgia Lupi, "[Data Humanism](http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold)."

::: notes
Lupi calls on us - among other things - to:

see the imperfections and subjective nature of data collection & analysis

encourages us to embrace rather than simplify complexity

recognize that data is not just numbers but people

and that data can make us not just more efficient, but more human

(how?)

-   ::: notes
    -   focus on 1940 census - released in 2012

        -   most recent census to be released (with full individual-level data) until 2022 (1950 Census)

    -   encourages us to start at the individual, human level (of the respondent, census taker, census designer, policy maker, etc.)

    save for later:

    -   "paved the way for the use of modern statistical sampling methods and advanced computing machinery in government." (Bouk, 5-6)

## 1930 Census

![1930 Census](hidden-images/PaulMikecz_1930b.png)

::: notes
1930 census: here some cracks in the story begin to appear on paper. Here Paul's wife, my great-grandmother, is noted to not speak English, and they have 7 children, with all but the oldest and youngest - my grandfather - being girls. Also, under employment Paul is listed as unemployed with the code: 25 1a. Or is it 25-100?

1940 Census: Paul is listed alone and living in a group home. In some way, he had come full circle from the 1910 census when he lived in a boarding house as a recently-arrived immigrant and day laborer. But, What;s going on now in 1940?

## Data is / are Texts

Our data also reflects the flaws in our democracy... if we read **data as texts**:

::: incremental
-   texts that have author(s) and reflect their interests & strengths, biases & flaws; also reflect the dominant culture and institution's values (and fears)

-   texts that result from debates: about what questions to ask, how, and of whom? and how to record the answers

-   texts that belong to their time: reflect traditions and norms as well as shifts in those norms

-   texts that don't just record facts but impose them; data makers decide what and who counts

-   texts that live multiple lives
:::

::: notes
**multiple lives**:

## Other "Doorstep" Encounters

## Census Questions

## 1930 Census

![](hidden-images/PaulMikecz_1930b.png){fig-align="center"}

1930 Census:

-   asked about **unemployment** and had a long schedule for identifying different types of unemployment (unfortunately key to codes now lost)

-   also first to ask whether a person was a **war veteran**. Likely concern about WWI veterans

-   also asked whether a person owned a **radio**

## Census Analysis

![U.S. Domestic Migration, 1935 - 1940](images/topmetdests.png){width="800"}

\[many other uses... census & other data\]

## Census Study Gone Wrong

-   1840 Census: analysis lumped together Black Americans with the White "insane and idiots"

-   Hoffman, *Race Traits and Tendencies* (1896)

    -   key source: 1890 Census

    -   

::: notes
DuBois Review:

"In the Eleventh Census, Mr. Hoffman expresses great faith, and thinks it as reliable as any of the previous enumerations. There nevertheless exists in the minds of many scholars grave doubts as to the accuracy of a large part of this census, and a disposition to base few important conclusions on its results."

"most persons will at the outset be disposed to criticise the air of perfect conviction that pervades Mr. Hoffman's conclusions...."

"**Mr. Hoffman has by no means avoided the many fallacies of the statistical method. This method is after all nothing but the application of logic to counting, and no amount of counting will justify a departure from the severe rules of correct reasoning."**

1.  **Not contextualizing data with previous decades**

2.  **Need to contextualize with proper comparisons**

3.  Accuses FH's analysis of being "unscientific"

The proper interpretation of **apparently contradictory social facts, is a matter requiring careful study and deep insight**

**Mr. Hoffman has committed the unpardonable sin of publishing a book of 329 pages without an index.**

<!--[relationship between data and democracy - why data is essential for a democracy]-->

"As long as the people to be counted have a significant say in what matter and how the numbers will be used, then the census overflows with democratic potential. As long as the people control their own enumeration, then the quest to count each person is one of the purest expressions of democratic values." (Bouk 2022, 4)
