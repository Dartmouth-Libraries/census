-   17th - 19th centuries: British "bills of mortality"

-   "transactional forms for counting human bodies, whether alive or dead, are at the heart of the modern reality that tables of numbers are poor vectors for the emotional and social impact of human mortality." (22)

"[Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers]{style="color:blue"}, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.

## Data Humanism and the Census

Giorgia Lupi, "[Data Humanism](http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold)."

::: notes
Lupi calls on us - among other things - to:

see the imperfections and subjective nature of data collection & analysis

encourages us to embrace rather than simplify complexity

recognize that data is not just numbers but people

and that data can make us not just more efficient, but more human

(how?)

-   focus on 1940 census - released in 2012

    -   most recent census to be released (with full individual-level data) until 2022 (1950 Census)

-   encourages us to start at the individual, human level (of the respondent, census taker, census designer, policy maker, etc.)

    ::: notes
    save for later:

    -   "paved the way for the use of modern statistical sampling methods and advanced computing machinery in government." (Bouk, 5-6)

## Data is / are Texts

Our data also reflects the flaws in our democracy... if we read **data as texts**:

::: incremental
-   texts that have author(s) and reflect their interests & strengths, biases & flaws; also reflect the dominant culture and institution's values (and fears)

-   texts that result from debates: about what questions to ask, how, and of whom? and how to record the answers

-   texts that belong to their time: reflect traditions and norms as well as shifts in those norms

-   texts that don't just record facts but impose them; data makers decide what and who counts

-   texts that live multiple lives

## Census Questions

## Role of Data in a Democracy {.scrollable}

<!--[relationship between data and democracy - why data is essential for a democracy]-->

"As long as the people to be counted have a significant say in what matter and how the numbers will be used, then the census overflows with democratic potential. As long as the people control their own enumeration, then the quest to count each person is one of the purest expressions of democratic values." (Bouk 2022, 4)
