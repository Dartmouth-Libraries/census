# TO ACQUIRE A CENSUS API KEY
## 1. Request a key here:
   ## https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
## 2. Save the key in a plain text file that you save as "census_api.txt
    ## within your working directory (the folder you have set as your w.d. with setwd() above)
## 3. Open the census key in a plain text file with the commands below:
# fileName<-"census_api.txt"
# c<-read_file(fileName)
# c<-readChar(fileName,file.info(fileName))




# census_api_key(c, install = TRUE, overwrite=TRUE)  #install - only have to run this line once
# First time, reload your environment so you can use the key without restarting R.
# readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
# You can check it with:
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")

Question: how to get decennial census data for 2020?

```{r}
vars <- load_variables(2020, "acs5", cache = TRUE)
view(vars)
```

We can get data for the 2000, 2010, 2020 decennial censuses using tidycensus's get_decennial command (note: in a later lesson we will discuss how to find and use decennial census data from before 2000)

For example, running the code below imports the data from one variable ("P013001"), for each state, for the 2010 census. 

For more on using the tidycensus package, see [the webpage created by the package's authors.](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)

```{r}
age10 <- get_decennial(geography = "state", 
                       variables = "P013001", 
                       year = 2010)
head(age10)

```
